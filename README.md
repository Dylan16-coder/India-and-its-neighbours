# India-and-its-neighbours
In this personal project of mine , I compare the population growth,GDP and GDP growth of India and its neigbours(China,Pakistan,Nepal,Bhutan,Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) whilst practising and navigating through pandas,numpy,seaborn and matplotlib.
I collected all the data for this project from the macrotrends website and created an excel sheet for each country and used the same in the project.
